For this TIGJam I decided to do some copyright infridgment and do a 2d version of minecraft.
Of course, 4 days of hacking is not enought to do an exact implementation so this is what i could do.
Don't look at it as a ripoff or a sucky copy, look at it as a tribute.

The goal is to make a sandbox 2d plataformer that makes a lot of people smile, thats it.
No money will be generated by this and if there is a Cease and desist or any request from Notch to remove it, delete it, or burn it, i will do it. Yes if Notch asks for it I will print the source code, burn it and post a video of it all.

With that in mind, lets start.

The first MVP is to make a small plataformer with squares tiles, a character, and a infinite scrollable map.
After that, the mouse should allow us to intereact with the enviroment.
Next step: be able to place tiles
Finally, destroy a tile, and you can pick it.

After I get there, I will worry about getting textures, and randomize the map in a cool way.

If that happens, i will care about trees, and allow to craft stuff.

Lets go!

[DONE] Step 1: Make a canvas that takes all the screen.
[DONE] Step 2: Create a Map object, it has a 2*2 matrix
[DONE] Step 3: Render a couple of types of tiles in the screen.
Step 4: Create a Player object
Step 5: Make him appear on the screen.
Step 6: He can move(WASP and arrows)
Step 7: He can jump
Step 8: He can detect collision and stop jumping
Step 9: Scroll the map when he gets to a limit
Step 10: He can point
Step 11: He can delete
Step 12: He can put blocks
Step 13: Rest, sleep, this was a crazy day.

Weekend before TIGJam, I am going to start to get ready, get my mind clear and know exactly what i want to do.
I will use the default texture pack from Minecraft, but I want a 64*64 tile size instead of 16*16. That is 4 times bigger.
I want to use the same file, so i am going to play with images and sprites today, try to make a nice experiment to be ready on Thursday on how to start with canvas and images
